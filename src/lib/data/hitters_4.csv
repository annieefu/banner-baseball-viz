Juan,Soto,NYY,juansoto-removebg-preview,Julio Aguilar/Getty Images,22,.952,199,94.1,9,"Soto is in the top-5 in average exit velocity in 2024. At just 25 years old, he has plenty of years ahead of him, and if he re-signs with the Yankees, he'll get many more opportunities to hit at Camden Yards.",
Heston,Kjerstad,BAL,heston-removebg-preview,Kylie Cooper/Baltimore Banner,13,.731,5,TK,81,Once Kjerstad becomes an everyday player – and that could be as soon as 2025 – he'll be parking balls onto Eutaw Street with regularilty. Kjerstad's power has been his calling card since his days at the University of Arkansas.,
Gunnar,Henderson,BAL,henderson-removebg-preview,Ulysses Muñoz/Baltimore Banner,2,.268,69,TK,81,"Henderson would be the odds-on favorite, given his high exit velocity numbers and regular spot near the top of the Orioles' lineup. One of the top young hitters in baseball is under team control through 2028, allowing him years of chance to hit the warehouse.",
Colton,Cowser,BAL,colton-removebg-preview,Ulysses Muñoz/Baltimore Banner,17,.733,23,TK,81,"Cowser doesn't have prodigous power, but 20 home runs as a rookie is nothing to sneeze at. He hit one that went a projected 443 feet agianst the Phillies back in June, a sign of just how powerful his left-handed swing can be.",
Jackson,Holliday,BAL,holliday-removebg-preview,Ulysses Muñoz/Baltimore Banner,7,.517,5,TK,81,"If this is Jackson Holliday at just 20 years old, that's a scary thought for the rest of the league. His first big league homer travelled a projected 439 feet and will earn him a plaque on Eutaw Street. He's getting stronger every day, and will be in Balitmore for years to come.",
Shohei,Ohtani,LAD,ohtani-removebg-preview,Ronald Martinez/Getty Images,17,.943,224,TK,1.5,"Does this need an explanation? Only Aaron Judge has hit the ball harder on average than Ohtani this season. The problem is the Dodgers are in the National League, making his visits to Camden Yards sparse. But he crushed one a projected 456 feet in Baltimore in 2023, so don't count him out.",
Corey,Seager,TEX,seager-removebg-preview,Ronald Martinez/Getty Images,5,.872,200,TK,3,"Simply put, Seager is one of the best hitters in baseball, mashing at least 30 homers a year for each of the past three seasons. Seager's Texas Rangers come to Camden Yards often enough for this to be a possibility.",
Rafael,Devers,BOS,rafael-removebg-preview,Luke Hales/Getty Images,11,.856,200,TK,9,"A divisional foe such as Rafael Devers will get numerous cracks at hitting the warehouse each season. Devers also sees the ball extremely well at Camden Yards, hitting 13 dingers in 55 career games in Baltimore.",
